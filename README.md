**CP - Book Springer** => algorithms given in the end.
all data structures and all present.

**Algo.pdf** => all the very imp algos in one place. [name only]

**algorithm2** => continuation of ---
Has all the agorithms except DP in 50 pages. [ good ]

**Algorrithms** => exhaustive list of most of the algorithms used for Cp.

**AlgorithmsCode** => Has all the code and time-complexities for all algotrithms except DP. [ 306 pages ]

**AlgoSource** => Has some Algorithms written with code and basically a repo of some algos i might need.

**AllAlgorithms** => Good Content on DP and recursion [ good to read and understand ]
No content on basic things, good readable for advanced stuff.

**Handbook** => has every thing in one place, explanation and code all together given, similar to Cpspringer book.
Keep handy, read both this and springer for basic stuff.
Has a clickable index gg.

**CP Fundae** => learn according to this.

**fxtbook** => Too much info/ hard/ advanced [ dont use now ]
